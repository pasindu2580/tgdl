## 📝 Configuration Files

### credentials.json (Auto-Created)
```json
{
  "API_ID": 12345678,
  "API_HASH": "abcdef...",
  "BOT_TOKEN": "123456:ABC...",
  "USER_ID": 987654321,
  "DUMP_ID": -1001234567890
}
```

### my_bot.session
- Pyrogram bot session file (auto-created, deleted before each run)

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

| Issue | Solution |
|-------|----------|
| **Bot won't start** | Check credentials in cell; verify API_ID/HASH |
| **Downloads failing** | Check link validity; inspect Colab logs for rate-limits |
| **Video conversion slow** | Normal on free Colab; use Low quality or skip conversion |
| **Telegram upload fails** | Ensure DUMP_ID is correct; bot needs write permission |
| **Torrent won't work** | Install libtorrent: `pip install libtorrent` |
| **FFmpeg errors** | Colab installs it automatically; check cell output logs |
| **Out of space** | Colab free tier has ~80GB; delete old downloads or upgrade |

## 💡 Tips & Tricks

1. **Batch Downloads** — Send multiple links at once; bot queues them sequentially
2. **Custom Thumbnails** — Send an image in Telegram; bot uses it for all uploads
3. **Password Protection** — Use `/zipaswd` before upload to encrypt files
4. **Video Quality** — Set to Low for faster processing on free Colab
5. **Prefix/Suffix** — Automatically rename files (e.g., prefix: "MyChannel_", suffix: "_HD")
6. **Keep-Alive** — Bot auto-plays silent audio to prevent Colab session timeout

## Recent Fixes
- **YTDL Video Naming:** Videos downloaded using `ytdl` are now saved with their proper titles instead of their video IDs.
- **Thumbnail Format & Naming:** Thumbnails are now saved in `.jpg` format with video titles as filenames. YTDL thumbnails are properly detected and converted, avoiding issues with `.webp` format in Telegram clients.
- **Magnet Link Cleanup**: Fixed an issue where partially downloaded files from a canceled magnet link were not properly cleaned up and were being included in subsequent tasks.
- **Magnet Download Display**: Magnet link downloads now display in a readable format on the second attempt, improving user experience.
- **Improved Video Splitting**: Enhanced video splitting to correctly handle x265 encoded MP4s and MKVs, as well as x264 encoded MKVs, ensuring that video, audio, and subtitle tracks are all correctly processed.
- **Video Split Size Limit**: Fixed issue where split video parts reached up to 2GB and couldn't upload to Telegram. Now properly handles high bitrate videos by enforcing stricter split size limits to stay within Telegram's 2GB file size restriction.
- **Added WMV Conversion**: Added support for converting `.wmv` files. These files are now correctly identified as videos and sent for conversion.

**Happy Leeching! 🦐**
